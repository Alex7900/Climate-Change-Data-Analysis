# Climate Change Data Analysis (Group Project)
## Data Description
In the following report, we have carried out an analysis to see the how the increase of various factors have had a major contribution to climate change and global warming.

We have decided on using 6 data sets for this report which we think are the main contributors to the change in climate. The data sets are: Biofuel, Coal, Electricity, and Sea Ice, Natural Gas, Petro Liquids. These data sets have the following variables: Years, Production/Generation, Emission, Consumption, Sea Ice Index, and Sea Ice rates of change. Most of these variables are continuous except the Years variable which is categorical. Also, we have decided to take into consideration 6 of the countries provided in these data sets, which correspond to one of the largest contributors in each region of the world, and the last 21 years (2000-2021). The countries are: Canada, USA, China, Germany, Brazil, France. We have also included the general contribution of the world.
